### III. Project Description

#### A. Problem definition / purpose

The purpose of the app is to provide a means for users to find other people to engage in hobbies with together. Users can create listings centred on specific hobbies which include a brief description, date, time, location and number of people invited to join. Other users of the site can then search listings put up by others based on a specific hobby and Australian major city location. It aims to address barriers that prevent people from participating in their preferred hobby and picking up new hobby. Namely, barriers that exist in today's society that limit people's connections with others in the community and limit their ability to participate.

#### B. Functionality / features

The features of the app include:

- A search bar that allows users to search by hobby or by city or both

- User authentication

- A navbar with authentication protocols that only allows signed in users who have paid and created profiles to fully access listing details and join the listings's activities

- Stripe checkout payment page to protect and authenticate users' credit card information

- Users  are able to create listings that comes up as summarised cards in searches

- Users able to upload profile pictures to an AWS Server (S3)

#### E.Instructions on how to setup, configure and use your App

To set up and access the app in your own computer, follow the steps below. Please note that this app runs on Rails so you would need to have Ruby and Rails installed on your device. You will also need Postgresql. This app was developed under Rails version 5.2.3.

1. Open your terminal window
2. Navigate into the folder where you intend to store the repo and run the following commands in terminal: git clone https://github.com/tjde/Market
3. Then run: cd Market
             cd src
4. Run: bundle install -> to install required gems and dependencies for the app to run
5. Run: rails db:create -> to create the database
6. Run: rails db:migrate -> to migrate the database
7. Run: rails s -> to start the server
8. Go to your browser window and type this url: localhost:3000
9. The src code is stored in the src directory, any changes you wish to make to the app can be carried out by opening that subfolder in a code editor.

### IV. Design documentation


#### A. Design process

The group started by coming up with a large range of different ideas and writing down those that seemed interesting and achievable. We then considered the potential scope of these selected ideas before narrowing in on the hobby sharing idea. We proceeded to more thoroughly consider how this idea could be executed before moving on to the assignment brief. Our chosen idea is represented in the HobbyBuddies app, and is also the idea we believed had the most potential to be useful, engaging and marketable.

We then started a trello board with ideas for features and stretch goals we would like to achieve. At this point, we also checked the requirements of the project, ensuring that this would be added to an overall to-do list so as not to be missed.
We initially did potential wireframes in paper and when the layout was agreed on, this was laid out in balsamiq for a more polished interface. Moodboarding was done at Pexel where pictures were collected with a focus on colors that evoke a feeling of anticipation, joy and excitement to the user which is what we want them feel when they use the app and which ties to the app concept of being a platform where people may be able to find a new hobby they enjoy or friends they can do them with.

Following this early brainstorming and wirefarming, we worked on developing: user stories, an ERD and User Flow Diagram, ensuring the foundation for the app was meticulously laid out before proceeding with the actual coding. The ERD and wireframes in particular were then approved before proceeding further.
After this, based on the ERD and plans, the models and databases along with their associations were created. A decision was made to split the controllers based on their function and the agreed app structure. The project timeline and task allocation was reviewed each morning and at the end of the day to evaluate progress to completion. Once the background logic of the app was set and it was functional, testing and styling commenced to form the finalised web app which was deployed in Heroku. 

#### B. User stories

1. As Sylvia, I just moved to Sydney and want to go scuba diving with somebody so that I can meet someone new while having      fun.
2. As John, I want a partner to regularly run with in the morning so that I can be accountable to someone and effectively build a healthy habit.
3. As Daniel I want to try hiking so that I can shake up my usual routine and try something new with other people who know the ropes and can give me guidance.
4. As Amy, I want a regular buddy to go wall climbing with so that I can engage in an activity that I've always enjoyed but haven't been able to do without a partner.

#### C. A workflow diagram of the user journey/s.
Early in on the project we developed a core user flow that we were aiming to reproduce. This 'Happy Path' relies on a few layers of functionality and can be seen in the userflow diagram.

![User Flow Diagram](/docs/User_Flow_Diagram.png)

#### D. Wireframes
The first stage of our wireframes were completed on butchers paper. The general concept can be seen in the photo of the low fidelity framing below.

![Wireframe 1](/docs/Wireframe_1.png)

The next stage of wireframing was carried out using balsamiq. In stepping up the fidelity, we added a few additional views and ensured we had a mobile and desktop wireframe for each view. These can be seen below.

![Wireframe 1](/docs/Wireframe_1.png)

![Wireframe 2](/docs/Wireframe_2.png)

![Wireframe 3](/docs/Wireframe_3.png)

![Wireframe 4](/docs/Wireframe_4.png)

![Wireframe 5](/docs/Wireframe_5.png)



#### E. Database Entity Relationship Diagrams

There were a few stages for our ERD. The initial ERD, approved by the Lead Educator, is still accurate in terms of the key data objects that it tracks. The later stages added a couple of tables to track recurring information, e.g. "Cities", and updated the various columns we were using as the project developed slightly. Screenshots of three stages can be seen below and found in docs.

![ERD Stage 1](/docs/ERD_1.png)

![ERD Stage 2](/docs/ERD_2.png)

![ERD Stage 3](/docs/ERD_Marketplace_Final.png)


### V. Planning Process

#### A. Project plan & timeline

We utilised a project management tool for project planning and timelining found on Monday.com. The web application allows you to create tasks, mark their importance, allocate team members, provide updates on task status and allocate a time frame for each sprint. It generates a visual timeline of the project based on the input. The screenshots below showcase both of these features.

![Project Timeline Stage 3](/docs/Project_Timeline_3.png)

![Project Timeline Stage 4](/docs/Project_Timeline_4.png)


#### B. Screenshots of Trello board(s)

Trello was used as a place to document features to be implemented and also for documenting how the application would meet the requirements of the assignment brief. The screenshots below are held in docs/Trello_1 2 and 3

### VI. Short Answer Questions

##### A. Project Challenge

The challenge that we are addressing in this project is to build a fully functional rails webapp that is fully deployed over the internet. This app will be a double-sided marketplace with authentication, authorisation, a payment function, aws cloud storage and image uploading features. 

##### B. The Problem and why it is important
<!-- Identify the problem youâ€™re trying to solve by building this particular marketplace App? Why is it a problem that needs solving? -->

With the increasing number of individuals choosing to travel and move to other places, it can be difficult to build new friendships in foreign places. Hobbybuddies aims to address the need for connection by give people more chances to form more intimate connections through enaging in shared interests with smaller groups of people.


##### C. Project Description
<!-- Describe the project will you be conducting and how your App will address the needs.  -->

Our app, HobbyBuddies, enables individuals to quickly find and join the activity listings posted by other people who are planning to engage in a specific activity of interest. Upon visiting the website, a user is able to search listings based on a specific hobby and city in Australia. This will only be a brief snippet of the listing, however. After the succesful completion of the sign in process where they will be prompted to pay a nominal one off fee and complete their profile, the user can then create their own listings that others can join or see the specific details of the listings of others and mark that they intend to join in. 

##### D. App Network Infrastructure
<!-- Describe the network infrastructure the App may be based on. -->

Heroku is the central network piece for our deployed App. It relies on Github for accessing your source code. Essentially, the code is stored in a remote location, as part of Github's file structure, and associated with the application's local repository. Thus, as code is pushed to that remote, Heroku is able to access the updated code.

The Heroku platform then executes the application on it's system, retrieving dependancies and assets. This process initalises what is known as a Dyno, a virtualized Unix container inside their system based on the app's file structure. Importantly, the application's slug is also identified as a 'web' process. Heroku then works with the inbuilt Rails web server, 'Puma', to allow for HTTP request traffic. Heroku's routers manage the flow of these requests in and out of the application and Puma receives them and returns a response compiled from the source code.

The last component is the production database. Heroku creates a new instance of postgresql on their system by running the migrations and seed file (if specified). This database exists separately on the network (for security) and Heroku manages the flow of information to and from the database.

##### E. Software Usage
Identify and describe the software to be used in your App.

A range of software was utilised, including:

- Trello â€“ For ideation, overall task list and user stories
- Monday â€“ For actual development timeline overview and task allocation
- Balsamiq Cloud â€“ For Wireframing
- Pexel â€“ For moodboarding
- ERD Software online â€“ For creating our entity relationship diagram
- Github â€“ To hold our git repo
- Slack â€“ To communicate and share documentation


##### F. Database
Identify the database to be used in your App and provide a justification for your choice.

The database used in our app is Postgresql. Firstly, sql is the default database built into rails so no additional software needs to be installed. Second of all, a relational database like posgresql allows for for a way to structure our data to more easily obtain the data we require like user hobbies or cities as our app relies on retrieving data based on the relationships between information in the user profile and the listings they create. 


##### G. Production Database Setup
<!-- Identify and describe the production database setup (i.e. postgres instance). -->

As discussed briefly in the network section, Heroku creates a new instance of a postgresql database. This occurs automatically if the gemfile includes the 'pg' gem. Alternatively, the command "$ heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev" tells heroku to create a postgresql database on the free tier. A database url is automatically added to the app's configuration that allows the app to communicate, over the network, with the instance of postgresql created by Heroku.

The database tables are setup based on the migration files in the source code of the application. Additionally, these tables can be populated from the seed file by running a heroku run rake db:seed command. A number of rake commands are built in to the heroku platform to allow the application manager to update and adjust the database setup.

The database for our app is currently structured to track Listing, User and Profile information. There are a few minor tables connected with these models to hold information related to them. 

##### H. App Architecture
Describe the architecture of your App.

Our app runs on the Ruby on Rails framework which acts as our server side development platform. The database used is Postgresql which is a relationship database linking information from different tables based on relationship associations. It uses Amazon Web Services S3 as active storage for any user profile images uploaded. The Devise gem is used to authenticate users. Stripe payment checkout is used to allow the app to accept payments from users in a secure way. Heroku is the cloud platform used to deploy our app in the internet.

##### I. App Abstractions
Explain the different high-level components (abstractions) in your App.

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern allows for a separation of concerns. This means that each part of the application deals with specific areas of functionality. Thanks to Rails configuration based approach, this is possible with minimal setup.

The Model takes care of managing the data of the application and the logic pertaining to the retrieval of that data. The model files are where we establish the associations between different database objects and act as a guide for the Object Relational Mapping built into Rails.

The View holds the least abstraction, as it is primarily responsible just for the html. However, Rails does provide some clever configuration that utilises form helpers, and interaction with the controller, to simplify the edit and new forms into one partial that acts responsively depending on whether it is passed an empty record or a populated one.

The Controllers are probably where the most abstraction occurs. They act as the intermediary between the Model and the View, holding key logic that handles user requests, routes the data obtained from the Model and sends it to the View to be presented to the user. The gem Devise adds a lot to this inbuilt abstraction. Allowing us to pass logic to easy to understand helper methods e.g. 'user_signed_in?'. This not only simplifies the build process but makes the code easier to understand for other developers. Passing these methods into the application controller is particularly powerful, as it allows us to impact our whole site efficiently and consistently with authorisation and authentication.

##### J. Third Party Services
Detail any third party services that your App will use.

The app uses the following third party services:
 - Amazon Web Services S3 - To serve as storage for image files uploaded by the users for their profiles
 - Stripe - This is used to accept credit card payments from users in order to use the full functionality of the webapp
 - Heroku - This serves as the deployment platform for our webapp so it can be used over the internet

##### K. Marketplace Apps with similar data structure
Describe (in general terms) the data structure of marketplace apps that are similar to your own (e.g. eBay, Airbnb).

The marketplace apps that have similar data structure to ours but in a much larger scale are Ebay and Gumtree where items are linked together in relationship associations and are accessed in this way. For instance, to list items on Ebay and Gumtree, you would need to pick an overall category, then subcategory before reaching the form that allows you to list the specific aspects of the item. Similary, our app uses forms like these for users to put up listings where other users can go and retrieve specific listings based on the hobby and city parameters. Currently, our database is setup with each hobby placed under a named category using a belongs_to association. This does not currently have a function but can eventually serve a similar purpose, where users select categories and subcategories when creating a listing in order to facilitate similar search capabilites to a marketplace like Ebay.

Both of these two-sided marketplaces also track user/profile data, and associate these records with listing data in various ways. For example, a user can 'watch' a listing. This would likely create a record similar to the join tables we have used to allow user's to favorite a listing. A user can also create and own a listing. Each listing recognizes whether the user signed in created it, and thus whether they have authorisation edit the listing or otherwise. Finally, a user can purchase an item. This is handled largely through Ebay, incorporating a third party payment app, and they store and track purchase data to ensure they can effectively handle legal disputes. This data would need to be associated with a payment, an item and a user. Again, this is somewhat similar to the associations we have created between users and listings in the attendees join table.

##### L. Database Relations
Discuss the database relations to be implemented.

As mentioned before in discussing the database setup. The key objects being tracked in our application are listing, profile and user. The most basic of the associations here are between profile and user. A user has one profile and a profile belongs to a user. This ensures that a profile cannot be created without a person being signed in as a user through Devise's authentication process. A profile then has many listings and a listing belongs to a profile. This means that only one profile is identified as owning each listing, and thus being authorised to manage that listing. There are some other minor associations involved in setting up a listing. A hobby has on category, and has many listings. This means that a listing belongs to a hobby. This setup allows us to find listings through categories or hobbies, providing a good search method for the user. A listing and a profile also belong to a city, which is setup as a separate table, allowing for location targeted searching from a prepopulated list of locations.

The remaining assocations are slightly more complex, utilising the has many through assocations. A listing and a profile are both connected to the attendees and favorites tables. This allows for records to be created that identify for each listing, who is attending. For each profile, what are they attending and what have they favorited. Profiles are also connected to hobbies in a similar way, through join tables, that allows the user to indicate hobbies they currently participate in and ones they would like to. This is primarily for future functionality involving suggesting listings to users based on activity and their interests.

##### M. Active Record Associations of the Models
Describe your projectâ€™s models in terms of the relationships (active record associations) they have with each other.

The project is setup to ensure information is accessible from the standpoint of a profile, and from a listing.

To further expand on the above. We can utilise the built in active record associations to call, for example, Listing.listing_attendees.profiles. This allows us to identify,on a listing page, who is attending/how many are attending. It also allows us to identify, for a user, what events they have marked themselves as attending. It also allows us to call current_user.profile.listings in order to identify for the user what listings they have created and give them links to manage those listings.

##### N. Database Schema Design
Provide your database schema design.

As seen above, our database schema is based on our ERD. The final iteration of that can be seen below. Alternatively, the schema file itself can be found under src/app/db/schema.rb

![ERD Stage 3](/docs/ERD_Marketplace_Final.png)

##### O. User Stories
Provide User stories for your App.

1. As Sylvia, I just moved to Sydney and want to go scuba diving with somebody so that I can meet someone new while having      fun.
2. As John, I want a partner to regularly run with in the morning so that I can be accountable to someone and effectively build a healthy habit.
3. As Daniel I want to try hiking so that I can shake up my usual routine and try something new with other people who know the ropes and can give me guidance.
4. As Amy, I want a regular buddy to go wall climbing with so that I can engage in an activity that I've always enjoyed but haven't been able to do without a partner.

##### P. Wireframes
Provide Wireframes for your App.

The wireframes for our application are linked above, at the top of our readme

##### Q. Task Allocation and Tracking
Describe the way tasks are allocated and tracked in your project.

An initial list of overall tasks based on discussed features and requirements were compiled. From here, the team used Monday.com, an online project management software to evaluate pending and current tasks to distribute to team members and keep abreast of things. As a project management application it provides a numer of tools that allowed us to allocate tasks, divide tasks and keep each other updated on progress. This is discussed further above.

##### R. Agile Method Implementation
Discuss how Agile methodology is being implemented in your project.

Our application development process relied heavily on the Agile methodology. The app was segmented carefully into distinct features that were allocated and given a time frame. These large features, e.g. authorization, were further broken down into smaller stages. These short stages were treated as sprints. Pieces of work that could be quickly and easily coded,then quickly and easily tested, adjusted then committed. Thus,these larger features were split into sprints running for a number of days, allocated between the two team members. In order to ensure the efficiency of this process, progress was tracked through Monday.com and each feature marked with it's respective importance and current status. Please see screenshots above under the project timeline section.

##### S. Source Control
Provide an overview and description of your Source control process.

The team structured our git repository so that the Master branch is only ever updated with working code through the GitHub online interface. Another remote branch called â€˜Devâ€™, short for 'development', acted as the intermediary for potential merge conflicts. For the majority of the project, these were the only two remotes maintained. Both team members created separate branches locally that they used to edit and test code before merging into the development branch. Any conflicts were then resolved locally, using the Visual Studio tool for managing conflicts. Finally, a git pull command would be run to manage any conflicts between the remote dev and local dev before pushing it to GitHub. Pull requests were then used to update the Master branch, relying on the GitHub interface to identify conflicts between dev and master, although this did not occur. Each of the local branches were then updated by pulling from the remote master.

##### T. Testing Process
Provide an overview and description of your Testing process.

The team consolidated a list of the key features of the app in a column on the spreadsheet. We then compiled several test cases for each feature that we believe should work or not work in a separate sheet, marking each test with it's feature id and unique test id. We then identified the outcome that we wanted for that particular test case, i.e. what functionality we were expecting. We then worked through each test case, listing down the results and comparing them to what was expected. A few major issues were identified, fixed in the code and that test case run through again to ensure proper resolution. For more information, a full copy of the testing spreadsheet is attached above.

##### U. Information System Security Requirements
Discuss and analyse requirements related to information system security.

The majority of the requirements for information system security are met by the Devise gem. The Devise gem provides a secure and efficient way to authenticate users, confirm their identity and then creates a bunch of methods for the application. These methods ensure that authorisation is carried out effectively through the app. Devise a number of things built into it that utilise encryption to make sure all of it's processes are secure. The final requirement to be considered is a CSRF attack. Fortunately, Rails has built in a method to ensure any HTTP requests that look to affect data, e.g. "Create, Update, Destroy", are filtered using authenticity tokens. This prevents malicious users from sending constructed HTTP requests to our application in order to retrieve, edit or destroy data. Additionally, our search method and forms utilise inbuilt Rails methods to ensure that sql injection is not possible.

##### V. Data Protection
Discuss methods you will use to protect information and data.

Our app does not store any confidential user information like addresses, phone numbers. Profiles only have a general city location of the users to narrow down the scope of search. Users of the app cannot directly search for other users to look in their information. They can only see the profile of the User who created a listing. However only the actual logged in user is able to see their Last name and Email. this information is not available to other users viewing their profile. No payment information is stored. All credit card information and payment details are handled by Stripe. All private data, like user email and password, are handled securely by Stripe. Stripe relies on Warden to secure this information and protect other users from accessing it through sql injection etc.

#### W. Legal Obligations with User Data
Research what your legal obligations are in relation to handling user data.

Broadly speaking, an organisation is responsible for ensure the privacy and security of user information that they receive. This specifically relates to information that is considered private like personal details. This requirement is set out by the Privacy Act of 1988 which can be found on a website maintained by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner. Chapter three of the Act looks specifically at solicited personal information. This is primarily what we are dealing with as the application in it's current form does not actively track any data it has not openly requested from the user. Within this data, we are expected to distinguish what information could be considered 'sensitive'. It is also important to ensure that we are only soliciting this information where it is reasonable expected that we need it for the functionality of the application. The website also contains a summarised guide for startups looking to comply with the Privacy Act. [OAIC Privacy Act guide for startups](https://www.oaic.gov.au/agencies-and-organisations/business-resources/privacy-business-resource-18#start-ups-and-the-privacy-act).
It recommends the Privacy by Design approach. Essentially, it suggests that the best way to ensure ongoing regulatory compliance with the Privacy Act is to consider, systematically, what information is being collected, can that information be considered private or sensitive, and is that information securely stored. It provides a number of tools to achieve that and a number of other resources for more specific situations like health records etc.
