##### A. Project Challenge

The challenge that we are addressing in this project is to build a fully functional rails webapp that is fully deployed over the internet. This app will be a double-sided marketplace with an authentication, authorisation, payment function and image uploading ability. 

##### B. The Problem and why it is important

Identify the problem you’re trying to solve by building this particular marketplace App? Why is it a problem that needs solving?

With the increasing number of individuals choosing to travel and move to other places, it can be difficult to build new friendships in foreign places. Hobbybuddies aims to address the need for connection by give people more chances to form more intimate connections through enaging in shared interests with smaller groups of people.


##### C. Project Description

Describe the project will you be conducting and how your App will address the needs. 

Our app, HobbyBuddies enables individuals to quickly find and join the activity listings posted by other people who are planning to engage in a specific activity of interest. Upon visiting the website, a user is able to search listings based on a specific hobby and city in Australia. This will only be a brief snippet of the listing, however. After the succesful completion of the sign in process where they will be prompted to pay a nominal one off fee and complete their profile, the user can then create their own listings that others can join or see the specific details of the listings of others where they themselves can join.
